        <h2>Types of Application Development</h2>
        <h3>Waterfall</h3>
        <p> It is a linear model that divides a project into sequential phases like Design, Implementation, Verification, Maintenance and Design. </p>
        <p> This means all details of the project must be decided upfront - which is a disadvantage. </p>
        <p> BUT, this does make it better for smaller projects where such details can easily be decided. </p>
        <p> Another disadvantage of waterfall application development is that it must stay linear, so it can only progress one direction and cannot be diverted. </p>
        
        <h3>Agile</h3>
        <p> This model breaks down the project into smaller 'sprints', which typically last multiple weeks. </p>
        <p> This allows for a larger team to split into smaller teams to handle tasks. </p>
        <p> You recieve constant feedback, allowing you to adapt each step at a time instead of all at once. </p>
        <p> This also means if any problems arise or if the client wishes for any changes, they can be made without major affect to the rest of it. </p>

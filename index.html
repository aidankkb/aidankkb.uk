        <h2>Types of Application Development</h2>
        <h3>Waterfall</h3>
        <p> It is a linear model that divides a project into sequential phases like Design, Implementation, Verification, Maintenance and Design. </p>
        <p> This means all details of the project must be decided upfront - which is a disadvantage. </p>
        <p> BUT, this does make it better for smaller projects where such details can easily be decided. </p>
        <p> Another disadvantage of waterfall application development is that it must stay linear, so it can only progress one direction and cannot be diverted. </p>
        
        <h3>Agile</h3>
        <p> This model breaks down the project into smaller 'sprints', which typically last multiple weeks. </p>
        <p> This allows for a larger team to split into smaller teams to handle tasks. </p>
        <p> You recieve constant feedback, allowing you to adapt each step at a time instead of all at once. </p>
        <p> This also means if any problems arise or if the client wishes for any changes, they can be made without major affect to the rest of it. </p>
        
        <h3>Extreme</h3>
        <p> This method prioritises customer satisfication through constant tests and surveying. </p>
        <p> The priority becomes solving any issues from customer feedback, instead of the entire problem. </p>
        <p> This method isn't great with larger projects however, as you would want to solve the problem constantly and not take too many pauses. </p>
        
        <h3>Spiral</h3>
        <p> This method combines methods of waterfall and agile - it repeats four stages (Planning, Risk Analysis, Engineering, Evaluation) until the project is complete. </p>
        <p> This allows adaptation to any upcoming problems, and the constant risk analysis prevents any issues. </p>
        <p> Spiral application development should not be used if you are not expecting many/any risks. </p>
        
        <h3>Rapid</h3>
        <p> Also known as RAD, this method cycles through four phases - Requirement Planning, User Design & Prototyping, Rapid Construction and Finalization. </p>
        <p> This method should be used if you are needing to complete it quickly, or if you have a set of testers available to use. </p>
        <p> It should not be used if a project is going to take a while, as user feedback / prototype opinions may change by the end of the products development. </p>
